Can salt be black??? I'm not sure but "pepper" surely is.
You are given 15 salted hashes and a list of 100 passwords from which any 15 were used to get these hashes.

"Flag format is DJSISACA{<triplet1>_<triplet2>_..._<triplet15>_<base_salt>}
where a <tripletX> = (first letter of password X) + (digit for X) + (suffix for X)"
