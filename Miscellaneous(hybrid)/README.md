# Miscellaneous Challenges

This folder contains the non‑crypto, puzzle‑style challenges I authored for BreachBytes 3.0.

## Challenge list

- **Binary Mayhem** (easy)  
  Binary blob that renders into ASCII art, revealing a short ciphertext which must be solved using a spiral/route cipher to obtain the flag.

- **Ecclesia Abyssi** (easy)  
  Image‑based puzzle with Templar imagery and wall symbols; players identify and apply the Templar (Pigpen‑style) cipher to decrypt the markings into the final narrative flag.
