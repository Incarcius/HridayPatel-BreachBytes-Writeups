"There exist short sentences which include all the alphabets." a quick google search will tell us this is hinting to pangrams investigating the first few links:
1) https://www.rd.com/list/fun-pangrams/
2) https://www.orchidsinternationalschool.com/blog/pangrams
3) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram
we basically get a list of possible pangrams and we can match the number of letters with the first sentence from the ciphertext and after matching a few, one of the more common pangram matches which is "The five boxing wizards jump quickly".
after this we can create a key mapping each letter to an emoji like:
A = 😂
B = 😊
C = 🤣
D = 👌
E = 😁
F = 😢
G = 🙌
H = 😎
I = 🤞
J = 😍
K = ❤️
L = 🙂
M = 😉
N = 🤗
O = 🤩
P = 😮
Q = 😆
R = 😘
S = 👍
T = 😑
U = 😒
V = 😶
W = 🫡
X = 😣
Y = 🤑
Z = 😴
using this we get the plaintext "THE FIVE BOXING WIZARDS JUMP QUICKLY. THE FLAG IS THE LAST WORD. THE FLAG IS PANGRAMSENTENCES." 
we can now encapsulate it in DJSISACA{} to get the flag "DJSISACA{PANGRAMSENTENCES}".
