### Step 1: Identifying the cipher

The description and imagery strongly hint at an order of knights that later became pirates.  
A bit of research leads to discussions like *“Did the Templars become pirates?”*, where it is theorized that some surviving **Templar knights** turned to piracy after escaping persecution.  
This is reinforced by the Templar‑style emblem visible on the white robe in the challenge image, suggesting a Templar‑themed cipher.

### Step 2: Decrypting the symbols

Looking into ciphers associated with the Knights Templar, you eventually encounter the **Templar cipher**, a historical variant of the **Pigpen cipher**.  
Applying the Templar cipher to the symbols carved on the wall in the image yields a readable plaintext that directly forms the flag:
